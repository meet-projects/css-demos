## Demo 1 - Basic CSS
This demonstrates how to use the style.css file to change the style of the HTML.

## Demo 2 - Tag Selectors
This demonstrates how tag selectors work. Feel free to tinker with the CSS in style.css to change the properties of h1 and p tags.

## Demo 3 - Class and ID Selectors
This demonstrates the use of class and ID selectors. Feel free to change around the CSS, and also create a new class or ID.

## Demo 4 - Positioning
This demonstrates positioning. This might be most clear if you change the positioning of the "inner" class to be relative, absolute, and static. Change around the "top" and "left" properties to show how things change.

## Demo 5 - Width and Height
This demonstrates how to adjust the width and height of elements. Change things up as you wish, using both pixels and percentages to demonstrate how things change.

## Demo 6 - Margins and Padding
This demonstrates margins and padding. Make sure to show the shortcuts on slide 56 by changing margins and padding as you see fit.
